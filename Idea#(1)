Random idea.

The scene prove how preceptive Soraki can be, and also how bad Sakura at common sense.

Situation : 
After a PE class Soraki notice that Sakura are pouting. Noticing that he saw her BMI result. Using the number he calculate her 
weight by using her height after some observation. Somehow, he accidentaly mutter the result that her by her (since she sat 
beside him). This resuting a puppy eye from her.

Soraki being quite weak toward girl (struggle) thus start to suggest method to lose weight to her. "Well Sakura, the simplest way 
to lose weight is to reduce your food intake and exercising." Sakura dislike the idea of less eating and moving. ""No way, I rather 
die than not eating." "No, I didn't ask you to not eat. Just reduce the amount." remark Soraki.

Lose at thought, Sakura suddenly ask Soraki on what kind of activities that so simple but can also burn calories. Soraki, still 
in deep thinking answered,"Well, I once read that kissing for 1 minute can burn 26 calories".

Realised what his answer try to imply, Soraki fumbly try to fix it. However, the seed of thought has been planted. Sakura, with her 
shiny eyes and big childish smile, finally found the easy way out - try to steal a kiss from him prompting a start of Soraki 
disastrous day.
